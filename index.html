		<section id="about">
			<h3> About Me </h3>
			<p> I am obsessed with science, in love with creating art, and passionate about yoga. </p>
			<p> I believe yoga and meditation have the ability to heal, strengthen, and balance. I combine my expertise in neuroscience, experiences as a competitive athelete, and love for creative expression in my teaching.</p>
			<p> Where do I begin? I'm a yoga teacher based out of Chicago, IL. I grew up as a competitive swimmer and was introduced to yoga while competiting for the Harvard swim team. Since that first class, I've become a dedicated yoga practitioner and received by 200 hour Yoga Alliance license through Boston's Karma Yoga Studio. My classes are vinyasa-flow based and I have taught a variety of students, ranging from very beginner to the fitness-lover.</p>
			<p> In college, I studied neuroscience and East Asian philosophy. These two unique perspectives allowed me to develop a deeper understanding in my yoga practice. I researched under Dr. Sara Lazar, which allowed me the opportunity to study mindfulness meditation's effects on the brain. </p>

			<h3> Favorite Poses </h3>
			<div class="pose bondi-blue">
				<h4> Vrksasana </h4>
				<div class="pose-back">
					<h4> Tree Pose </h4>
					<p> Grounding. Balance. Joy. These elements can all be found in this accessible pose, Vrksana. I do this pose every day. </p>

			<div class="pose jazzberry-jam">
				<h4> Baddha Konasana </h4>
				<div class="pose-back">
					<h4> Bound Angle Pose </h4>
					<p> <em>Yum</em> is all I can think when I do this pose. This amazing hip-opener allows my mind to settle and my body to relax. So good after a stressful day. </p>

						<h4> Navasana </h4>

						<h4> Boat Pose </h4>
						<p> Navasana reminds me to be proud of who I am and to stand up for myself. The activation of my core in this pose helps me find my center. </p>

						<h4> Camel Pose </h4>
						<p> This chest expansion makes me feel exhilerated. The key though is to be fully warmed up! If I'm not prepared, I tend to over-compensate in my lower back. Ouch. </p>
